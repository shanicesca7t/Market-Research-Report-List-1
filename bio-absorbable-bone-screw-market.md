<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bio-absorbable Bone Screw Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fully Threaded Screws</li><li>Partially Threaded Screws</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The bio-absorbable bone screw market is primarily categorized into fully threaded and partially threaded screws. Fully threaded screws feature a continuous thread design along their entire length, providing enhanced grip and stabilization for bone fixation. In contrast, partially threaded screws have threads covering only a portion of their length, allowing for improved compression and flexibility in bone alignment. Both types are utilized in orthopedic surgeries, as they gradually degrade within the body, eliminating the need for a second surgery to remove hardware.</p></p>
